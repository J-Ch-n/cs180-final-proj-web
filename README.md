Welcome to my project 5.

This project has two parts living in two separate files. 

PartA:
- The file name is proj5A.ipynb
- The Jupyter notebook should have clear instructions as to where each section is since I haven't changed the structure of the skeleton code.
- The only note is that I used some custom prompts, so the text embedding cells at the end of the file must be run for some of my code to work.

PartB:
- The file name is proj5B.ipynb
- The Jupyter notebook should have clear instructions as to where each section is.
- For Time and Class conditioned UNets, I didn't not use the skeleton code classes. Instead, I wrote my only training loop function. Nevertheless, each section should have an appropriate title, and relevant functions are grouped together.
